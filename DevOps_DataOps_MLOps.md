# MLOps
* MLOps - Combination of DevOps-style automation methods and ML best practices focused on deployment and operations of ML models into production systems.

* DevOps - Culture of collaboration and automation of developer operations to continuously improve deployment and reduce friction between business units. Includes automation tools and principles like CI/CD.

* [CI/CD](https://cloud.google.com/architecture/mlops-continuous-delivery-and-automation-pipelines-in-machine-learning#mlops_level_1_ml_pipeline_automation) - Continuous integration and continuous delivery - key practices in DevOps workflows. CI involves regular automated testing and validation of incrementally-built software while CD focuses on automatically releasing updates to environments like production.

* Maturity Model - Concept in MLOps defining ascending levels, typically 4-5, of MLOps sophistication and effectiveness, from manual, siloed, unreliable to scalable, autonomous, and resilient systems.
* Data Ops - Specific focus on use of DevOps concepts and automation principles to manage data workloads like aggregation, transformation, storage, analysis, etc.
* [Feature Store](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/machine-learning/feature-store/) - Central repository to manage, store, and serve ML features for model building and retraining. Optimizes data pipelines and reuse.

* Infrastructure as Code: Managing and provisioning infrastructure through code instead of manual processes. This allows environment configuration, deployment, and management to be consistent and repeatable across development stages.
* [Data drift](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/how-to-monitor-datasets?tabs=python&view=azureml-api-1) refers to changes in the statistical properties of data over time, which can negatively impact the performance of machine learning models, it's necessary to re-trian the model
* End-to-End MLOps - Fully automating the machine learning lifecycle from model development through deployment and hosting via platforms like Hugging Face Spaces.
* AWS App Runner - A fully managed service for deploying containerized web services and APIs.
* Flask - A popular, lightweight Python web application framework.
* Makefile - A file containing a set of directives used to automate building and managing a project: (lint, test, format) -> build 
* Requirements File - A text file containing a list of Python package dependencies used by an application.
